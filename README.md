This repository contains a database of Roblox games that have been tested under Proton 8.0. Any games with a rating below Platinum have their respective issues mentioned, if any.

For an understanding of ratings:

- **Platinum**: The game runs (almost?) flawlessly.
- **Gold**: The game runs well with minor issues.
- **Silver**: The game runs well, but may experience some moderate to major issues.
- **Bronze**: The game runs, but not particularly well. Major issues are present and need to be addressed.
- **Garbage**: The game either refuses to run or its anti-cheat detects WINE as a false positive.

This list grows whenever I get enough time to test more games. If you use Proton and would like to add games and ratings to the database, feel free to open a pull request.
