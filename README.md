As of 24th August 2023, Roblox works under WINE once again. It is worth nothing howether that it won't work on the modified WINE-TKG 7.20 as Roblox added a check that requires a minimum Wine version of 8.0, but versions 8.15 and above are recommended.

This repository contains a database of Roblox games that have been tested under Grapejuice's modified WINE-TKG 7.20. Any games with a rating below Platinum have their respective issues mentioned, if any.

For an understanding of ratings:

- **Platinum**: The game runs (almost?) flawlessly.
- **Gold**: The game runs well with minor issues.
- **Silver**: The game runs well, but may experience some moderate to major issues.
- **Bronze**: The game runs, but not particularly well. Major issues are present and need to be addressed.
- **Garbage**: The game either refuses to run or its anti-cheat detects WINE as a false positive.

This list grows whenever I get enough time to test more games. If you use Grapejuice's WINE-TKG and would like to add games and ratings to the database, feel free to open a pull request.

If you feel daunted by the text file, you may instead refer to [this repository's wiki.](https://github.com/MagelessMayhem/Roblox-WINE-DB/wiki/Page-1)
